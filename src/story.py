        They offer you a drink and you move into the Grand Lounge with your two comrades. \

        The power goes out and several screams are heard throughout the house along with various other noises you can't identify.\n \
        You assume that some people must have fallen when the power went out. \
        The power comes back on and everyone in the Grand Lounge is shocked to see {1} lying on the floor motionless with a small arrow in their back. \
        You are stunned and the {2} quickly yells to the butler to call for an ambulance and the police for a murder has occurred.  \
        {3} starts to tell everyone to remain calm as panic slowly starts to creep in among the party guests. \n \
        Just as everyone starts to calm down, to the extent they are capable of anyways after all a murder had just happened right in front of them, \
        the butler returns to relay the news that the phones are down.  \
        The valet then drives the final nail in the coffin by telling everyone in the Grand Lounge that the road to the manor has been blocked by trees \
        and that the small bridge has collapsed due to the raging waters caused by the downpour. \n \
        Slowly the eerie truth that they are stuck in the mansion at least until morning starts to sink into the minds of the party goers including yourself. \
        After finishing the rest of your drink, you decide that you will use the knowledge you have obtained so far in \
        your physics career to solve this murder so that no one else comes to harm.\n"\
