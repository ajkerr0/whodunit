        Minkowski Manor is a large two story mansion with a basement.  A heavy storm is brewing and in fact a downpour has already begun.  \
        However, the Physics Social is one of the largest events of the year and the host {0} regularly brags about the safety of the residence.\n \
        Upon entering you shed your rain soaked coat and are quickly greeted by {1} and Werner Heisenberg.  \
        They offer you a drink and you move into the Grand Lounge with your two comrades. \

        The guests have all taken it upon themselves to move freely about the manor nosing their way through the hostâ€™s possessions.\
        You lean in to tell Heisenberg a dirty joke when lightning strikes just outside the Dining Room window shaking the whole house with the deafening thunder.\
        The power goes out and several screams are heard throughout the house along with various other noises you can't identify.\n \
        You assume that some people must have fallen when the power went out. \
        The power comes back on and everyone in the Grand Lounge is shocked to see {1} lying on the floor motionless with a small arrow in their back. \
        You are stunned and the {2} quickly yells to the butler to call for an ambulance and the police for a murder has occurred.  \
        {3} starts to tell everyone to remain calm as panic slowly starts to creep in among the party guests. \n \
        Just as everyone starts to calm down, to the extent they are capable of anyways after all a murder had just happened right in front of them, \
        the butler returns to relay the news that the phones are down.  \
        The valet then drives the final nail in the coffin by telling everyone in the Grand Lounge that the road to the manor has been blocked by trees \
        and that the small bridge has collapsed due to the raging waters caused by the downpour. \n \
        Slowly the eerie truth that they are stuck in the mansion at least until morning starts to sink into the minds of the party goers including yourself. \
        After finishing the rest of your drink, you decide that you will use the knowledge you have obtained so far in \
        your physics career to solve this murder so that no one else comes to harm.\n".format(random.randint(1,10), self.name(2), self.name(0), self.name(0)))
